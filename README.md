# Echo
EchoConcept:  A top-down maze game where your character is in total darkness.  The only way to “see” the maze is by sending out sound pulses that reveal the walls for a second.  Enemies patrol the maze, and they can hear you if you “ping” too often.  Goal: find the exit before getting caught.
